# train-schedule
I created a Firebase backed train schedule application using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and Java/jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page. I used Firebase to host a globally available set of data that is retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various train arrival times and minutes until then.
